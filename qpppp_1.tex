\ABSTRACT{This paper provides a comprehensive overview of
quantile-parameterized distributions (QPDs) as a tool for capturing
expert predictions and parametric judgments. We survey a range of
methods for constructing distributions that are parameterized by a set
of quantile-probability pairs and describe an approach to generalizing
them to enhance their tail flexibility. Furthermore, we explore the
extension of QPDs to the multivariate setting, surveying the approaches
to construct bivariate distributions, which can be adopted to obtain
distributions with quantile-parameterized margins. Through this review
and synthesis of the previously proposed methods, we aim to enhance the
understanding and utilization of QPDs in various domains.}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Judgment plays a crucial role in transforming raw data into meaningful
insights. To be useful, judgment must be translated into mathematical
models and assumptions. These models are designed to capture the
expert's understanding of the world, including the causal links between
relevant entities. The models serve as a representation of this
understanding, while also addressing knowledge limitations, treated as
uncertainties. Elicitation involves translating qualitative
understanding into quantitative models offering valuable insights.

Most of the expert elicitation protocols described in the literature
\citep{hanea2021ExpertJudgementRisk, gosling2018SHELFSheffieldElicitation, ohagan2006UncertainJudgementsEliciting, hemming2018PracticalGuideStructured, morgan2014UseAbuseExpert, welsh2018MoreorlessElicitationMOLE, spetzler1975ProbabilityEncodingDecision}
encode expert judgments about the parameter or quantity of interest as
an ordered set of quantiles with corresponding probabilities. This
typically includes measures such as the median and the upper and lower
quartiles. Assessors are then encouraged to select a probability
distribution that reasonably fits the elicited quantile-probability
pairs and validate the choice with the expert
\citep{gosling2018SHELFSheffieldElicitation}. A distribution is selected
from a predefined set of ``simple and convenient'' distributions
\citep{ohagan2006UncertainJudgementsEliciting} with boundedness that
accounts for the nature of the elicited quantity.

Several specialized distributions have been developed to facilitate
smooth interpolation of probabilistic assessments. These distributions,
parameterized by quantile-probability pairs, ensure that the elicited
quantile-probability pairs (QPPs) are exactly preserved
\citep{keelin2011QuantileParameterizedDistributions, powley2013QuantileFunctionMethods, keelin2016MetalogDistributions, hadlock2017QuantileparameterizedMethodsQuantifying, wilson2023ReconciliationExpertPriors}.
Quantile-parameterized distributions are particularly valuable thanks to
the interpretability of their parameters. By leveraging the elicited
quantiles, these distributions enable precise capturing of expert
knowlegde while maintaining a high level of flexibility in modeling.

We believe that the primary utility of QPDs lies in their ability to
simplify the specification of probability distributions for model
parameters, known as \emph{prior elicitation}
\citep{mikkola2021PriorKnowledgeElicitation}. However, these same
distributions can also be employed to describe an expert's predictions
for the next observation, referred to as \emph{predictive elicitation}
\citep{winkler1980PriorInformationPredictive, kadane1980PredictiveStructuralMethods, akbarov2009ProbabilityElicitationPredictive, hartmann2020FlexiblePriorElicitation},
or to capture both uncertainty and variability through a two-dimensional
probability distribution in \emph{hybrid elicitation}
\citep{perepolkin2024HybridElicitationQuantileparametrized}.

With this work, we aim to introduce quantile-parameterized distributions
(QPDs) to a wide readership. The literature review and the findings are
presented through the perspective of quantile functions, building upon
the theoretical foundations established by Parzen
\citep{parzen1979NonparametricStatisticalData} and Gilchrist
\citep{gilchrist2000StatisticalModellingQuantile}. The derivatives and
inverses for each of the quantile functions discussed in the paper are
provided in the Supplementary Materials, serving as a valuable reference
for future research. Through our comprehensive review and identification
of research gaps, we aim to contribute to the development of flexible
and extensible distributions that can effectively capture expert
knowledge.

\subsection*{Paper structure}\label{paper-structure}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Paper structure}

In Section 2, we revisit the approaches to quantile parameterization of
probability distributions and explore how QPDs can effectively describe
expert beliefs regarding model parameters or predictions. In Section 3,
we conduct a comprehensive review and comparison of various continuous
univariate QPDs found in the literature. Specifically, we focus on the
Myerson distribution and its generalization accommodating different tail
thicknesses. We compare the robust moments of QPDs to assess their
flexibility and behavior. This comparative analysis can guide the
selection of an appropriate distribution to characterize the quantity of
interest. In Section 4, we explore several methods for extending
univariate distributions to a multivariate setting. These methods
include the utilization of standard multivariate distributions, copulas,
and bivariate quantiles. We show how these techniques can be applied to
develop a bivariate version of the Generalized Myerson distribution and
demonstrate its application in parametric and predictive elicitation.
Finally, in Section 5, we discuss future research directions and
potential applications of QPDs in Bayesian analysis.

\section{Quantile parameterization of probability
distributions}\label{quantile-parameterization-of-probability-distributions}

A fundamental principle in Bayesian data analysis is that learning from
data involves more than formulating hypotheses and models. It
necessitates articulating prior beliefs, expressing existing knowledge
mathematically, and translating it into probability distributions for
model parameters.

To accurately translate knowledge into the language of statistical
models the encoding distribution needs to be flexible, the process
should be transparent, and the results must be interpretable. For
continuous distributions, elicitation often consists of capturing a
series of quantile-probability pairs (QPPs)
\citep{kadane1998ExperiencesElicitation, morgan2014UseAbuseExpert}, and
then fitting a distribution to these pairs
\citep{ohagan2019ExpertKnowledgeElicitation}. However, in practice, the
choice of a parametric distribution to fit the elicited QPPs is often
influenced by concerns about conjugacy with the selected statistical
model that represents the data-generative process (the likelihood
function) and/or the availability of required distribution functions and
fitting algorithms in the software employed. Frequently, the selected
distribution possesses fewer parameters than the number of elicited
QPPs, which can result in a less-than-perfect fit
\citep{ohagan2019ExpertKnowledgeElicitation}. For instance, it is common
to elicit three quantiles (the median along with an upper and lower
quartile) and subsequently attempt to fit a normal or lognormal
distribution (which features two parameters) to these points.

An alternative approach to characterizing the distribution of
predictions or parameters is through quantile-parameterized
distributions (QPDs). These distributions are parameterized by the QPPs,
allowing the elicited values to directly define the distribution,
thereby ensuring a good fit and interpretability of parameters. The QPDs
examined in this paper can accommodate a wide range of shapes and
boundedness, making them valuable for accurately representing experts'
prior beliefs.

QPDs are constructed using the \emph{quantile function}, either by
transforming simpler quantile functions or by simultaneous fitting of
parameterizing quantiles, as described below.

Let \(Y\) be a random variable with a (cumulative) distribution function
(CDF) denoted as \(F_Y(y\vert\theta)\). The quantile function (QF)
\(Q_Y(u\vert\theta)\) for \(Y\) is defined as

\[
Q_Y(u\vert\theta)=\inf\{y:F_Y(y\vert\theta)\geq u\}, \; u\in[0,1]
\]

Here, \(\theta\) represents the distribution parameter, and the
subscript \(_Y\) indicates that the depth \(u\) corresponds to the
\textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{observation of the} random variable \(Y\).
\textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{The intermediate cumulative probability \(u\)
is referred to as the \emph{depth}, because it indicates how ``deep'' an
observation is into the distribution
\citep{perepolkin2023TenetsQuantilebasedInference}.}

Both the CDF and the QF are considered equally valid ways of defining a
distribution \citep{tukey1965WhichPartSample}. For a distribution
function that is right-continuous and strictly increasing over the
support of \(Y\), the quantile function \(Q_Y(u)\) is simply the inverse
of the distribution function, denoted as
\(Q_Y(u\vert\theta)=F_Y^{-1}(u\vert\theta)\). Therefore, the quantile
function is often referred to as the \emph{inverse CDF}.

The derivative of the quantile function, known as the \emph{quantile
density function} (QDF), is denoted as \(q(u) = \frac{dQ(u)}{du}\). It
is reciprocally related to the probability density function (PDF)
\(f(x)\), such that \(f[Q(u)]q(u) = 1\). The quantity
\(f_Y[Q_Y(u\vert\theta)]=[q_Y(u\vert\theta)]^{-1}\) is referred to as
the \emph{density quantile} function
\citep{parzen1979NonparametricStatisticalData} or \emph{p-pdf}
\citep{gilchrist2000StatisticalModellingQuantile}. The relationships
between these functions are concisely illustrated in the probability
function Möbius strip (Figure~\ref{fig-moebius-chart}).

}

\citep{perepolkin2023TenetsQuantilebasedInference}}

\end{figure}%

Although many of the distributions discussed in Section 3 have
closed-form cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) and probability
density functions (PDFs), the functional form of the quantile function
(QF) is often simpler and can be reasoned about in terms of other
quantile functions, following \emph{Gilchrist's QF transformation rules}
summarized in Table~\ref{tbl-qf-trans}.

\end{table}%

The quantile-parameterized distributions in this paper are categorized
into two groups based on their construction method. The first group
comprises distributions that are \emph{directly} parameterized by the
quantile-probability pairs (QPPs). This group includes the Myerson
distribution \citep{myerson2005ProbabilityModelsEconomic}, and the
Johnson Quantile-Parameterized Distribution
\citep{hadlock2017JohnsonQuantileParameterizedDistributions, hadlock2019GeneralizedJohnsonQuantileParameterized}.
These distributions are constructed by reparameterizing or transforming
existing distributions, following Gilchrist rules
(Table~\ref{tbl-qf-trans}). The transformations used to construct them
are detailed in the next section.

The other group of distributions is \emph{indirectly} parameterized by
the QPPs. They require a fitting step where the quantile-probability
pairs are translated into distribution parameters, usually through
optimization or least-squares methods. This group includes the Simple
Q-Normal \citep{keelin2011QuantileParameterizedDistributions}, Metalog
\citep{keelin2016MetalogDistributions}, and the quantile-parameterized
Triangular (Two-Sided Power) distribution by Kotz and van Dorp
\citep{kotz2004BetaOtherContinuous}. Each distribution's fitting method
is described in the respective subsections below.

\section{Univariate quantile-parameterized
distributions}\label{univariate-quantile-parameterized-distributions}

This section reviews various continuous univariate QPDs appearing in the
literature. We then discuss the generalized form for these
distributions, based on the variations of these QPDs appearing in the
literature. For each distribution, we present its quantile function and
discuss the parameterization and feasibility conditions. The derivative
and inverse of each distribution can be found in Appendix A.

\subsection{Myerson distribution}\label{myerson-distribution}

One of the earliest examples of a distribution parameterized by
quantiles is the \emph{generalized log-normal} distribution defined by
the median and the upper and lower quartiles proposed by
\citep{myerson2005ProbabilityModelsEconomic}. It relies on a
transformation of the normal quantile function.

The Myerson distribution can be viewed as parameterized by three
quantile values \(\{q_1, q_2, q_3\}\), which correspond to the
cumulative probabilities \(\{\alpha, 0.5, 1-\alpha\}\). These quantiles
are symmetrical around the median and are defined by the tail parameter
\(0<\alpha<0.5\). This type of parameterization is known as the
Symmetric Percentile Triplet (SPT, \(\alpha\)-level SPT or
\(\alpha\)-SPT) parameterization. It is also used in several other
quantile-parameterized distributions that we describe below. The Myerson
quantile function is

\[
\begin{gathered}
\rho=q_3-q_2;\; 
\beta=\frac{\rho}{q_2-q_1};\;
\kappa(u)=\frac{S(u)}{S(1-\alpha)}\\
Q_Y(u \vert q_1,q_2,q_3,\alpha)=
\begin{cases}
q_2+\rho\frac{\beta^{\kappa(u)}-1}{\beta-1}, \quad &\beta \neq 1\\
q_2+\rho\kappa(u), \quad &\beta =1
\end{cases}
\end{gathered}
\]

Here, \(u\) represents the depth of the observations of the random
variable \(Y\) given the parameterizing \(\alpha\)-SPT
\(\{q_1, q_2, q_3, \alpha\}\), with \(0 < \alpha < 0.5\). The parameter
\(\rho\) is the \emph{upper p-difference}, and \(\beta\) is the ratio of
the inter-percentile ranges, known as the \emph{skewness ratio}
\citep[72]{gilchrist2000StatisticalModellingQuantile}. The \emph{kernel}
quantile function \(S(u)\) is equal to the quantile function of the
standard normal distribution, also known as the \emph{probit}, defined
as \(S(u) = \Phi^{-1}(u)\), where \(\Phi(Y)\) denotes the CDF of the
standard normal distribution. The formulas for the derivative and the
inverse quantile function of the Myerson QPD can be found in the
Supplementary Materials.

It is important to note that while the Myerson distribution includes the
normal distribution as a special case when the skewness parameter
\(\beta = 1\), it can exhibit right-skewness or left-skewness for other
values of \(\beta\). In the symmetrical case, the range of the quantile
function is \((-\infty, \infty)\). For the right-skewed distribution
(\(\beta > 1\)), the range is
\((q_2 - \frac{\rho}{\beta - 1}, \infty)\), and for the left-skewed
distribution (\(0 < \beta < 1\)), the range is
\((-\infty, q_2 - \frac{\rho}{\beta - 1})\). The limiting case of the
skewed Myerson distribution \(\lim_{u \rightarrow 0} Q_Y(u\vert\theta)\)
for \(\beta > 1\) (and the other limit for \(0 < \beta < 1\)) possesses
some important properties that we discuss in
Section~\ref{sec-genmyerson} below.

The basic quantile function
\citep{gilchrist2000StatisticalModellingQuantile, lampasi2008AlternativeApproachMeasurement}
\(S(u)\) underlying the Myerson distribution is a simple \emph{probit},
\(S(u) = \Phi^{-1}(u)\), transformed using the exponentiation function
\(T(x) = \beta^{x}\) Table~\ref{tbl-qf-trans}, where \(\beta > 0\)
represents the skewness ratio
\citep{gilchrist2000StatisticalModellingQuantile}. The quantile
parameterization is facilitated by \(\kappa(u)\), which takes values
\(\{-1,0,1\}\) for the three quantiles \(\{q_1, q_2, q_3\}\), such that
\(Q(\alpha) = q_1\), \(Q(0.5) = q_2\), and \(Q(1 - \alpha) = q_3\).

\subsection{Johnson Quantile-Parameterized
Distribution}\label{johnson-quantile-parameterized-distribution}

\citet{hadlock2017QuantileparameterizedMethodsQuantifying} reviewed the
existing quantile-parameterized distributions and proposed the quantile
parameterization of the Johnson SU family of distributions
\citep{johnson1994ContinuousUnivariateDistributions}.
\citet{hadlock2017JohnsonQuantileParameterizedDistributions} presented
two versions of the distribution: the bounded (J-QPD-B) and the
semi-bounded (J-QPD-S), both parameterized by an SPT
\(\{q_1, q_2, q_3, \alpha\}\) and the bound(s).

The J-QPD-B distribution is obtained by applying the inverse-probit
transformation to the Johnson SU quantile function
\(Q_{SU}(u) = \xi + \lambda\sinh[\delta(S(u) + \gamma)]\), where
\(\delta\) and \(\gamma\) are two shape parameters. This function is
then rescaled to the compact interval \([l_b, u_b]\). The J-QPD-B
quantile function is

\[
Q_B(u)=
\begin{cases}
l+rS^{-1}\left[Q_{SU}(u)\right], n\neq0\\
l+rS^{-1}\left[B+\kappa S(u)\right],n=0
\end{cases}
\]

where

\[
\begin{gathered}
Q_{SU}(u) = \xi + \lambda\sinh[\delta(S(u) + \gamma)]\\
r=(u_b-l_b); \quad \gamma=nc; \quad \kappa=\frac{H-L}{2c}\\
S(u)=\Phi^{-1}(u); \quad c=S(1-\alpha);\\
L=S\left(\frac{q_1-l_b}{u_b-l_b}\right); \quad  B=S\left(\frac{q_2-l_b}{u_b-l_b}\right);\\
H=S\left(\frac{q_3-l_b}{u_b-l_b}\right); \quad n=\text{sgn}(L+H-2B)\\
\xi=\begin{cases}L, \quad n=1,\\
B, \quad n=0,\\
H, \quad n=-1,\end{cases}\\
\delta=\frac{1}{c}\cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{H-L}{2\min(B-L,H-B)}\right)\\
\lambda=\frac{H-L}{\sinh(2\delta c)}
\end{gathered}
\]

\caption{\label{fig-jqpd1}Fitted J-QPD-B (left) and J-QPD-S (right)
distribution for prevalence at origin and total trade flow,
respectively}

\end{figure}%

The left panel in Figure~\ref{fig-jqpd1} showcases the J-QPD-B quantile
function, which is parameterized using 0.25-SPT and 0.01-SPT assessments
of the proportion of fruit infested with \emph{Citripestis
sagittiferella}, as elicited by
\citet{efsa2023RiskAssessmentCitripestis}. The dashed line represents
the Beta distribution fitted by the authors. The J-QPD-B, being
parameterized by an SPT, effectively captures three of the five
parameterizing quantiles, while the Beta distribution only provides an
approximation. Besides, finding parameters of Beta distribution requires
an optimization step.

The J-QPD-S distribution is a semi-bounded variant of the distribution
that employs exponentiated hyperbolic arcsine transformations of the
Johnson's SU quantile function
\(Q_{SUa}(u) = \xi + \lambda\sinh\left[\text{asinh}(\delta S(u)) + \text{asinh}(\delta\gamma)\right]\)
located at zero \(\xi=0\)
\citep{hadlock2017JohnsonQuantileParameterizedDistributions}

\[
\begin{gathered}
Q_S(u)=\begin{cases}
l_b+\theta\exp\left[Q_{SUa}(u)\right],n \neq 0\\
l_b+\theta\exp\left[\lambda\delta S(u)\right],n=0
\end{cases}
\end{gathered}
\]

where

\[
\begin{gathered}
Q_{SUa}(u) = \lambda\sinh\left[\text{asinh}(\delta S(u)) + \text{asinh}(\delta\gamma)\right]\\
r=(u_b-l_b); \quad \gamma=nc; \quad \kappa=\frac{H-L}{2c}\\
S(u)=\Phi^{-1}(u); \quad c=S(1-\alpha);\\
L=\ln(q_1-l_b); \quad  B=\ln(q_2-l_b);\\
H=\ln(q_3-l_b); \quad n=\text{sgn}(L+H-2B)\\
\theta=\begin{cases}
q_1-l_b, \quad n=1,\\
q_2-l_b, \quad n=0,\\
q_3-l_b, \quad n=-1,\end{cases}\\
\delta=\frac{1}{c}\sinh\left[\cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{H-L}{2\min(B-L,H-B)}\right)\right]\\
\lambda=\frac{1}{\delta c}\min(H-B, B-L)
\end{gathered}
\]

When \(n=\text{sgn}(L+H-2B)\) evaluates to zero, the result is a
lognormal distribution with parameters \(\mu=\ln(\theta)=\ln(q_2-l_b)\)
and \(\sigma=\lambda\delta=(H-B)/c\). This distribution has support on
the interval \([l_b,\infty]\).

The right panel in Figure~\ref{fig-jqpd1} depicts the J-QPD-S quantile
function, which is parameterized using 0.25-SPT and 0.01-SPT assessments
of the total trade flow for citrus fruit imported by the EU from
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam in tons/year
\citep{efsa2023RiskAssessmentCitripestis}.

\subsection{Generalisations of QPDs}\label{generalisations-of-qpds}

\subsubsection{Generalized Johnson Quantile-Parameterized
Distribution}\label{generalized-johnson-quantile-parameterized-distribution}

\citet{hadlock2019GeneralizedJohnsonQuantileParameterized} introduced
the \emph{generalized} version of the Johnson Quantile-Parameterized
distribution system, denoted as G-QPD, by replacing \(S(u)\) the probit
at the core of the Johnson SU quantile function with the quantile
functions of the logistic and Cauchy distributions. The standard
quantile function and distribution function of the logistic distribution
are given by \(S(u)= \ln\left(\frac{u}{1-u}\right)\),
\(F(y)=[\exp(-y)+1]^{-1}\). The standard quantile function and
distribution function of the Cauchy distribution are given by
\(S(u)= \tan\left[\pi\left(u-\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]\),
\(F(y)=\frac{1}{ \pi}\arctan(y)+\frac{1}{2}\).

\citet{hadlock2019GeneralizedJohnsonQuantileParameterized} show that the
\emph{kernel} quantile function \(S(u)\) can be any standardized
(\(S(0.5)=0\)), symmetrical (\(s(u)=s(1-u)\)), and unbounded
(\(S(u)\in(-\infty;\infty)\)) quantile function with a smooth quantile
density \(dS(u)/du=s(u)\). The authors further show that if \(S(u)\) and
\(S^{-1}(y)\) are expressible in closed-form, the quantile function and
distribution function of G-QPD will also be closed-form.

For the logistic kernel, the G-QPD-S represents the generalized
log-logistic distribution, characterized by two shape parameters,
\(\lambda\) and \(\delta\). For the Cauchy kernel, the G-QPD-S
corresponds to the shifted log-Cauchy distribution
\citep{hadlock2019GeneralizedJohnsonQuantileParameterized}.

\subsubsection{Generalized Myerson distributions}\label{sec-genmyerson}

Following the approach in
\citet{hadlock2019GeneralizedJohnsonQuantileParameterized}, the Myerson
distribution can be generalized by substituting the normal kernel
quantile function \(S(u)=\Phi^{-1}(u)\) with an alternative symmetrical
quantile function based on the depth \(u\). Below, we discuss possible
kernels and the resulting distributions:

\textbf{Logit-Myerson distribution}. Recently,
\citet{wilson2023ReconciliationExpertPriors} reparameterized the
log-logistic distribution in terms of a Symmetric Percentile Triplet.
Even though the authors do not recognize it as such, the resulting
quantile-parameterized distribution is a Myerson distribution with the
logit kernel QF \(S(u)=\ln\left(\frac{u}{1-u}\right)\).

There could be several reasons why one might prefer the logit function
over the probit function \citep{berkson1951WhyPreferLogits}. For
example, distribution based on logit may exhibit greater numerical
stability due to its simple closed-form quantile function, which does
not rely on numerical approximation during sampling. Logit-Myerson
distribution displays slightly heavier tails compared to the standard
(probit-based) Myerson distribution
(Figure~\ref{fig-gmyerson-qfdqf-plot1}).

\textbf{Sech-Myerson distribution}. Following the same principle, a
variant of Myerson distribution may be created using the hyperbolic
secant quantile function
\(S(u)=\ln\left[\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2}u\right)\right]\).

The Sech-Myerson distribution possesses even thicker tails than the
Logit-Myerson distribution for the same parameterizing SPT
\(\{-5,4,16, 0.25\}\) (Figure~\ref{fig-gmyerson-qfdqf-plot1}). In
Section~\ref{sec-compareqf}, we conduct a comparative analysis of
different variations of the Generalized Myerson distribution alongside
their parametric counterparts and other quantile distributions.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth,height=\textheight]{qpppp_1_files/figure-pdf/fig-gmyerson-qfdqf-plot1-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-gmyerson-qfdqf-plot1}Quantile function and quantile
density of Generalized Myerson Distributions}

\end{figure}%

Theoretically, there is an infinite range of quantile function kernels
that can be utilized to generate new variations of the Generalized
Myerson distribution. These candidate kernel distributions can even
include shape parameters, as long as the resulting \(S(u)\) remains
standardized, symmetrical, and unbounded, as specified above. For
instance, it is possible to incorporate the basic QF of the Tukey Lambda
distribution \(S(u\vert\lambda)=u^\lambda-(1-u)^\lambda\) for a fixed
\(\lambda \neq 0\), or the Cauchy distribution
\(S(u)=\tan[\pi(u-0.5)]\), as employed by
\citet{hadlock2019GeneralizedJohnsonQuantileParameterized}. However, not
all standard quantile functions are created equal. To illustrate the
issue of unreliable kernels, let us consider Myerson distributions based
on the Cauchy and Tukey Lambda quantile functions (for
\(\lambda=-0.5\)). As can be observed in
Figure~\ref{fig-gmyerson-qfdqf-plot2}, the density of the Generalized
Myerson distribution with these kernels exhibits unexpected spike near
the lower bound.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth,height=\textheight]{qpppp_1_files/figure-pdf/fig-gmyerson-qfdqf-plot2-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-gmyerson-qfdqf-plot2}Quantile function and quantile
density of Generalized Myerson Distributions with unreliable kernels}

\end{figure}%

While all right-skewed Generalized Myerson distributions are bounded on
the left at
\(\lim_{u\rightarrow0}Q(u\vert\theta)=q_2-\rho\frac{1}{\beta-1}\)
regardless of the kernel used, the quantile density at the left limit
\(\lim_{u\rightarrow0}[q(u\vert\theta)]^{-1}\) is not independent of the
kernel. Although we can assume that \(q(0)=\infty\), the lower tail of
the density quantile function \([q(u)]^{-1}\) may exhibit a curling
effect for certain kernels, resulting in an increase in density for
lower values of \(u\). This effect is caused by the non-monotonic
behavior of the quantile convexity function \(c(u)=dq(u)/du\). This can
be easily verified by taking the second derivative of \(\beta^{S(u)}\)
for \(\beta>0\). While such kernels are mathematically valid and yield a
non-decreasing Generalized Myerson QF, we believe that they may be less
useful due to the counter-intuitive concentration of density in the
bounded tail. Consequently, we do not recommend using Cauchy or Tukey
Lambda kernels in practical applications.

\subsection{Simple Q-Normal, Metalog
distributions}\label{simple-q-normal-metalog-distributions}

An alternative system of quantile-parameterized distributions was
proposed by Keelin and Powley
\citep{keelin2011QuantileParameterizedDistributions, powley2013QuantileFunctionMethods}.
Their approach relies on the finite Taylor expansion of parameters in
standardized quantile functions. Within this framework, two
distributions were introduced: the Simple Q-Normal distribution and the
Metalog distribution.

The Simple Q-Normal (SQN) distribution was developed by expanding the
parameters in the normal quantile function.
\citet{keelin2011QuantileParameterizedDistributions} used this method to
express the parameters of the normal quantile function
\(Q(u\vert\mu,\sigma)=\mu+\sigma z(u)\) as linear functions of the depth
\(u\). Specifically, \(\mu(u)=a_1+a_4u\) and \(\sigma(u)=a_2+a_3u\),
where \(z(u)=\Phi^{-1}(u)\) denotes the standard normal quantile
function. Therefore, the quantile function of the SQN distribution can
be expressed as:

\[
Q(u)= a_1+a_2z(u)+a_3uz(u)+a_4u\\
\]

where \(z(u)=\Phi^{-1}(u)\), and \(\mathbf{a}=\{a_1,a_2,a_3, a_4\}\)
represents a vector of parameters.

Consider a quantile-probability tuple of size 4, denoted as
\(\{\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q}\}_4\), which consists of an ordered vector of
cumulative probabilities \(\mathbf{p}=\{p_1,p_2,p_3, p_4\}\) and an
ordered vector of corresponding quantiles
\(\mathbf{q}=\{q_1,q_2,q_3, q_4\}\). Substituting these vectors into the
SQN quantile function for \(u\) and \(Q(u)\), respectively, we obtain
the matrix equation \(\mathbf{q}=\mathbb P\mathbf{a}\), where
\(\mathbf{a}=\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\}\) represents the parameter vector of
the SQN distribution and

\[
\begin{gathered}
\mathbb P=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & z(p_1) & p_1z(p_1) & p_1\\
                1 & z(p_2) & p_2z(p_2) & p_2\\
                1 & z(p_3) & p_3z(p_3) & p_3\\
                1 & z(p_4) & p_4z(p_4) & p_4\end{bmatrix}.
\end{gathered}
\]

The parameter vector \(a\) can be obtained by solving the matrix
equation above, given the 4-element quantile-probability tuple
\(\{\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q}\}_4\)
\citep{keelin2011QuantileParameterizedDistributions, perepolkin2024HybridElicitationQuantileparametrized}.

The same approach was later employed by
\citet{keelin2016MetalogDistributions} in creating the metalog
(meta-logistic) distribution. Starting with the quantile function of the
logistic distribution \(Q(u\vert\mu,s)=\mu+s\text{logit}(u)\), where
\(\mu\) corresponds to the mean and \(s\) is proportional to the
standard deviation \(\sigma=s\pi/\sqrt3\),
\citet{keelin2016MetalogDistributions} expanded the parameters \(\mu\)
and \(s\) using a finite Taylor series centered at 0.5. Specifically,
\(\mu(u)=a_1+a_4\check{u}+a_5\check{u}^2+\dots\), and
\(s(u)=a_2+a_3\check{u}+a_6\check{u}^2+\dots\), where
\(\check{u}=u-0.5\) and \(a_i, \; i = \{1,2,\dots,n\}\) are real
constants.

Therefore, the metalog quantile function is:

\[
\begin{gathered}
Q(u)= a_1+a_2\text{logit}(u)+\\
a_3\check{u}\text{logit}(u)+a_4\check{u}+a_5\check{u}^2\cdots,
\end{gathered}
\]

where \(\check{u}\) is the centered depth \(\check{u}=u-0.5\).

Given a QPT of size \(m\) denoted by \(\{\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q}\}_m\),
where \(\mathbf{p}\) and \(\mathbf{q}\) are ordered vectors of
cumulative probabilities and corresponding quantiles, respectively, the
vector of coefficients \(\mathbf{a}={a_1,\dots,a_m}\) can be determined
by solving the matrix equation \(\mathbf{q}=\mathbb{P}\mathbf{a}\),
where \(\mathbf{p}\), \(\mathbf{q}\), and \(\mathbf{a}\) are column
vectors, and \(\mathbb{P}\) is an \(m \times n\) matrix:

\[
\begin{gathered}
\mathbb{P} = \left[\begin{array}{lllll}
1  &\text{logit}(p_1) &\check{p}_1\text{logit}(p_1) &\check{p}_1 &\cdots\\
1  &\text{logit}(p_2) &\check{p}_2\text{logit}(p_2) &\check{p}_2 &\cdots\\
   &                  &\vdots\\
1  &\text{logit}(p_m) &\check{p}_m\text{logit}(p_m) &\check{p}_m &\cdots
\end{array}\right].
\end{gathered}
\]

The vector of coefficients \(\mathbf{a}\) can be determined as
\(\mathbf{a}=[\mathbb{P}^{T}\mathbb{P}]^{-1}\mathbb{P}^{T}\mathbf{q}\).
If \(\mathbb{P}\) is a square matrix, meaning the number of terms \(n\)
is equal to the size of the parameterizing QPT \(m\), the equation can
be further simplified to \(\mathbf{a}=\mathbb{P}^{-1}\mathbf{q}\).
Metalog is said to be \emph{approximated} when the number of
quantile-probability pairs used for parameterization exceeds the number
of terms in the metalog QF
\citep{keelin2016MetalogDistributions, perepolkin2024HybridElicitationQuantileparametrized}.

The SQN and Metalog distributions are families of extended distributions
that, in theory, can have an arbitrary number of terms.
\citet{keelin2016MetalogDistributions} demonstrated the flexibility of
the metalog distribution and its ability to approximate arbitrarily
complex probability density functions with high precision, given enough
terms in the metalog specification. In practice, 10-15 terms are
sufficient to approximate the distributional shapes of virtually any
complexity \citep{keelin2021MetalogDistributionsVirtually}.
\citet{keelin2016MetalogDistributions} introduced the bounded
logit-metalog, the semi-bounded log-metalog, and a special case of a
3-term metalog parameterized by \(\alpha\)-SPT (SPT-metalog).

However, not all combinations of parameters \(\mathbf{a}\) in metalog
and SQN distributions result in a feasible (non-decreasing) quantile
function. For an arbitrary \(\mathbf{a}\)-vector, feasibility must be
checked \citep{keelin2011QuantileParameterizedDistributions}. In the
case of 3-term metalogs, the feasibility conditions are straightforward
\citep{keelin2016MetalogDistributions}. However, as the number of terms
increases, these conditions become increasingly complex
\citep{keelin2017MetalogDistributionsFeasibility}. Dealing with such
feasibility requirements stands in contrast with QF's that are
constructed using Gilchrist rules (Table~\ref{tbl-qf-trans}), which
guarantee feasibility.

\subsection{Other distributions}\label{other-distributions}

\textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{Many classical parametric distributions can be
identified using a set of quantiles, though they may not be strictly
``quantile-parameterized''. That is, these distributions might not have
a closed-form quantile function expressed in terms of a
Quantile-Probability Tuple (QPT), but they can still have a unique set
of parameters corresponding to a QPT of matching size.}

\textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{\citet{cook2010DeterminingDistributionParameters}
demonstrates that any distribution from the location-scale family can be
parameterized using two quantiles. Consider a distribution with a
quantile function \(Q(u)=\mu + \sigma S(u)\), where \(S(\cdot)\) is a
basic quantile function. Given a quantile-probability tuple
\(\{\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q} \}_2\), composed of quantile values
\(\mathbf{q}=\{q_1, q_2\}\), and probabilities
\({\mathbf{p}=\{p_1, p_2\}}\), where \(x_1<x_2\) and \(p_1<p_2\), the
scale parameter \(\sigma\) can be computed as:}

\[
\sigma=\frac{q_2-q_1}{S(p_2)-S(p_1)}
\]

\textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{Similarly, the location parameter \(\mu\) can
be computed as:}

\[
\mu=\frac{q_1S(p_2)-q_2S(p_1)}{S(p_2)-S(p_1)}
\]

\textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{This means that distributions from the
location-scale family can be expressed using the quantile function}

\[
Q(u)=\frac{[q_1S(p_2)-q_2S(p_1)]+[q_2-q_1]S(u)}{S(p_2)-S(p_1)}
\]

\textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{\citet{cook2010DeterminingDistributionParameters}
also provides examples of quantile-matching for other two-parameter
distributions, where one or both parameters may be shape parameters.
Some distributions, like the Weibull, have closed-form solutions, while
others, such as the Beta distribution, require numerical optimization or
root-finding algorithms. \citet{vandorp2000SolvingParametersBeta} proved
the existence of a solution for the Beta distribution parameters based
on two quantiles, while \citet{shih2015ModelIdentificationBetaa}
demonstrated the uniqueness of that solution.
\citet{vandorp2000SolvingParametersBeta} outlines the procedure for
determining Beta distribution parameters using two quantiles.}

\citet{kotz2004BetaOtherContinuous} describe the
\textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{procedure for quantile parameterization} of the
triangular distribution \citep{johnson1997TriangularDistributionProxy}.
This bounded distribution is widely used in finance and insurance and is
popularized by the @Risk software package
\citep{palisadecorporation2009GuideUsingRISK}. The triangular
distribution is parameterized by the two quantiles \(q_{a}\) and
\(q_{b}\), and the mode \(m\), subject to the constraint that
\(a\leq q_a\leq m\leq q_b\leq b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) represent the
lower and upper bounds, respectively. The standard quantile function for
the triangular distribution is expressed in terms of the bounds \(a\),
\(b\), and the mode \(m\).

\[
\begin{gathered}
Q(u)=\begin{cases}
a+\sqrt{ud_ld}, \; \text{for } 0\leq u \leq\frac{d_l}{d}\\
b-\sqrt{(1-u)d_ud}, \; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{gathered}
\]

where \(d=b-a;\; d_l=m-a;\; d_u=b-m\).

\citet{kotz2004BetaOtherContinuous} show that given the two
parameterizing quantile-probability pairs \(\{q_a,p_a\}\) and
\(\{q_b,p_b\}\) and the mode value \(m\), there exists a unique value of
depth \(p_a<p<p_b\) corresponding to the root of the function

\[
g(p)=\frac{(m-q_a)(1-\tau_b)}{(q_b-m)(1-\tau_a)+(m-q_a)(1-\tau_b)}-p
\]

where \(\tau_b=\sqrt{\frac{1-p_b}{1-p}}\),
\(\tau_a=\sqrt{\frac{p_a}{p}}\).

The root value \(p\in (p_a,p_b)\) of the function \(g(p)\) can be found
using any of the bracketing root-finding algorithms
\citep{perepolkin2023TenetsQuantilebasedInference}. It can then be
substituted into the following expressions to find the lower \(a\) and
upper \(b\) limit parameters of the triangular distribution:

\[
\begin{gathered}
a(p) \equiv \frac{q_a-m\tau_a}{1-\tau_a}, \quad a(p)<q_a\\
b(p) \equiv \frac{q_b-m\tau_b}{1-\tau_b}, \quad b(p)>q_b
\end{gathered}
\] where \(\tau_b=\sqrt{\frac{1-p_b}{1-p}}\), and
\(\tau_a=\sqrt{\frac{p_a}{p}}\).

\citet{kotz2004BetaOtherContinuous} (Section 4.3.3) provide an algorithm
for fitting a four-parameter generalization of the triangular
distribution, called the Two-Sided Power Distribution (TSP), using three
quantile-probability pairs and a mode value. \textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{By
allowing the TSP power parameter \(n \rightarrow \infty\),
\citet{kotz2005LinkTwosidedPower} developed an algorithm for identifying
the parameters of the Asymmetric Laplace distribution with unbounded
support. Additionally, \citet{vandorp2021ThreepointLifetimeDistribution}
proved that a lower quantile, a mode, and an upper quantile uniquely
determine the left and right branch power parameters \(m, n > 0\) of a
Generalized Two-Sided Power (GTSP) distribution
\citep{herrerias-velasco2009GeneralizedTwosidedPower}, given a fixed
bounded support \([a, b]\). An algorithm to solve for the power
parameters \(m, n > 0\) of the GTSP distribution is also provided in
\citet{vandorp2021ThreepointLifetimeDistribution}. More recently,
\citet{vandorp2023GeneralizedTwosidedBeta} applied the same algorithm to
solve for the left and right branch power parameters \(m, n > 0\) of the
Generalized Two-Sided Beta (GTSB) distribution, which serves as a smooth
alternative to the GTSP distribution}

\subsection{Choosing quantile-parameterized
distribution}\label{sec-compareqf}

A common approach to assess the properties of probability distributions
is through central moments, denoted by \(\mu_k=\mathbb{E}[(Y-\mu)^k]\),
where \(\mu\) represents the expected value of \(Y\). Karl Pearson
introduced a classification system for distributions using moment ratios
associated with skewness and kurtosis
\citep{fiori2009KarlPearsonOrigin}:

\[
\beta_1=\frac{\mu_3^2}{\mu_2^3},\quad \beta_2=\frac{\mu_4}{\mu_2^2}
\]

While computing moments using the quantile function is straightforward
(the \(n\)-th raw moment is \(\mu_k=\int_0^1 Q(u)^k du\)), it may not be
possible to calculate higher-order moments for certain distributions.

Instead, robust alternatives to moments can be utilized, such as the
sample median \(\mu_r\), the interquartile range \(\sigma_r\), the
quartile-based robust coefficient of skewness \(s_r\)
\citep{kim2004MoreRobustEstimation}, also known as Bowley's skewness
\citep{bowley1920ElementsStatistics} or Galton's skewness
\citep{gilchrist2000StatisticalModellingQuantile}, and the octile-based
robust coefficient of kurtosis \(\kappa_r\), also known as Moors'
kurtosis \citep{moors1988QuantileAlternativeKurtosis}.

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\mu_r=Q(1/2)\\
&\sigma_r=Q(3/4)-Q(1/4)\\
&s_r=\frac{Q(3/4)+Q(1/4)-2Q(1/2)}{\sigma_r}\\
&\kappa_r=\frac{Q(7/8)-Q(5/8)+Q(3/8)-Q(1/8)}{\sigma_r}
\end{aligned}
\]

\citet{kim2004MoreRobustEstimation} and
\citet{arachchige2022RobustAnalogsCoefficient} have proposed to
standardize robust moments to facilitate their comparison with the
corresponding robust moments of the standard normal distribution.
\citet{groeneveld1998ClassQuantileMeasures} and
\citet{jones2011SkewnessInvariantMeasuresKurtosis} have introduced
generalizations of robust moments to other quantiles.

Unlike moments, quantiles are always well defined, and since QPDs are
parameterized by quantile-probability pairs, quantile-based robust
moments can sometimes be directly computed from the parameters. For
instance, if the basic quantile function \(S(u)\) in
\(Q(u)=\mu+\sigma S(u)\) is standardized (such that \(S(0.5)=0\)), where
\(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) are the location and scale parameters of \(Q(u)\)
respectively, then \(\mu_r=\mu\). Moreover, \(\sigma_r\) is always
independent of location, and \(s_r\) and \(\kappa_r\) are independent of
both location and scale.

Figure~\ref{fig-unbounded}, Figure~\ref{fig-semibounded}, and
Figure~\ref{fig-bounded} resemble the Cullen and Frey
\citep{cullen1999ProbabilisticTechniquesExposure} plots (also known as
the Pearson plots), but instead of using central moments they employ
quartile/octile-based robust metrics of skewness \(s_r\) and kurtosis
\(\kappa_r\) to compare the quantile-parameterized distributions to some
of their parametric counterparts.

In these plots, Metalog3 and Metalog4 refer to 3- and 4-term metalog
distributions, respectively, and GLDcsw refers to
\textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{Chalabi, Scott and Würtz}
\citep{chalabi2012FlexibleDistributionModeling} parameterization of the
Generalized Lambda Distribution (GLD). As can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig-unbounded}, all generalizations of Myerson distributions
have higher robust kurtosis for the same robust
skewness\textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{, which indicate heavier tails outside
of parameterizing quantiles.} Additionally, GLD CSW is more flexible
than the unbounded 4-term metalog. The \emph{log}-transformed metalog
distribution appears to be the \textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{most flexible}
among the semi-bounded distributions (Figure~\ref{fig-semibounded}).
Furthermore, the flexibility of the bounded J-QPD-B is at least as good
as that of the Beta and Kumaraswamy distributions
(Figure~\ref{fig-bounded}).

and 90th percentiles. In such cases, a wide variety of QPDs are

boundedness conditions.}

\textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{Figure~\ref{fig-conceptmap} illustrates the
selection of SPT-parameterized distributions for each type of
boundedness. Note that while Myerson distributions have implicit lower
and upper bounds, the other SPT-parameterized distributions have
explicit bounds, which must be provided by the expert. The distributions
are listed roughly in increasing order of robust kurtosis for the same
level of robust skewness. This consideration may prove useful during the
validation phase of the elicitation process, especially when the
assessor wishes to query the expert about a higher or lower quantile
outside the initial parameterizing triplet. If the tail of the
originally selected distribution is found to be too light (i.e., the
expert provides a higher or lower quantile that exceeds the value
implied by the selected distribution), the next distribution in the
ordering of robust kurtosis might be more appropriate. Note that while
this additional quantile may not be matched exactly, the newly chosen
distribution might approximate it more closely.}

\textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{If the elicited quantiles are asymmetrical
around the median (Figure~\ref{fig-conceptmap}), or if a higher number
of quantiles need to be matched (e.g., the assessor decides to match an
additional upper or lower quantile along with the previously elicited
SPT), the Metalog distribution is the only available option (out of the
QPDs with an explicit quantile function discussed in this paper). This
highly flexible distribution supports all types of distribution
boundedness and can accommodate more than a dozen quantile-probability
pairs. However, a limitation of the Metalog distribution is that it may
not always be feasible for any given QPT, meaning that in practice some
quantiles might need to be approximated rather than matched exactly.}

\section{Multivariate quantile-parameterized
distributions}\label{sec-multivariateqpd}

Quantile-parameterized distributions can serve as marginal distributions
in multivariate models, where the dependency structure is captured by a
standard (parametric) multivariate distribution, a copula, or described
by bivariate quantiles. The marginal distributions alone are
insufficient to determine the corresponding bivariate distribution,
resulting in an infinite number of bivariate distributions with the same
margins
\citep{gumbel1960BivariateExponentialDistributions, gumbel1961BivariateLogisticDistributions}.
In this section, we describe several methods for extending the
distributions parameterized by the quantile-probability pairs to become
Multivariate Quantile-Parameterized Distributions (MQPDs).

\subsection{MQPDs based on standard multivariate
distributions}\label{mqpds-based-on-standard-multivariate-distributions}

\subsubsection{Normal distribution}\label{normal-distribution}

In the simplest case, multivariate Quantile-Parameterized Distributions
(MQPDs) can be created using the multivariate normal distribution,
following the approach of \citet{hoff2007ExtendingRankLikelihood}. The
Myerson, J-QPD, and SQN quantile functions are Q-transformations of the
probit \(Q(z(u)\vert\theta)\), where \(z(u)=\Phi^{-1}(u)\) represents
the standard normal quantile function. The multivariate versions of
these distributions can be viewed as the Q-transformations of the
multivariate normal distribution. To extend these QPDs to \(J\)
dimensions using the multivariate normal distribution, we employ the
method outlined in \citet{drovandi2011LikelihoodfreeBayesianEstimation}.

The \(i\)-th component of a single observation \(y_i\) can be described
by the quantile function \(y_i=Q(z(u_i)\vert\theta_i)\), for
\(i=1,\dots,J\), where \(\theta_i\) represents the set of parameters for
component \(i\) (e.g., \(\{q_1,q_2,q_3, \alpha\}_i)\) for Myerson or
J-QPD distributions). The vector
\([z(u_1),\dots,z(u_j)]^T\sim N(0,\Sigma)\), where \(\Sigma\) denotes
the covariance matrix. For invertible distributions, the inverse
quantile function is the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
\(Q^{-1}(y_i\vert\theta)=F(y_i\vert\theta)\), otherwise, the inverse can
be computed numerically as
\(\widehat{F}(y_i\vert\theta)=\widehat{Q^{-1}}(y_i\vert\theta)\)
\citep{perepolkin2023TenetsQuantilebasedInference}.

\citet{drovandi2011LikelihoodfreeBayesianEstimation} show that the joint
density of a single (multivariate) observation \((y_i,\dots,y_J)\) can
be expressed as:

\[
\begin{gathered}
f(y_1,\dots,y_J\vert\theta)=\\
\varphi\Bigl[z\bigl(Q^{-1}(y_1\vert\theta_1)\bigr),\dots,z\bigl(Q^{-1}(y_J\vert\theta_J)\bigr);\Sigma\Bigr]\times\\
\quad \times\prod_{i=1}^{J}\frac{dQ^{-1}(y_i\vert\theta_i)}{dy_i}
\end{gathered}
\]

where \(z(Q^{-1}(y_i\vert\theta_i))=z_i\),
\(\varphi(z_1,\dots,z_J;\Sigma)\) represents the multivariate normal
density with a mean of zero and a covariance matrix of \(\Sigma\), and
\(\frac{dQ^{-1}(y_i)}{dy_i}=f(y_i)\) is the probability density function
(PDF) of the QPD (refer to Supplementary Materials).

For distributions without a PDF, the same joint density can be expressed
as a joint \emph{density quantile function}:

\[
\begin{gathered}
\\
[q(u_1,\dots,u_j)]^{-1}=\\
\varphi\bigl[z(u_1),\dots,z(u_J);\Sigma\bigr]\times\\
\quad \times \prod_{i=1}^{J}[q(u_i\vert\theta_i)]^{-1}
\end{gathered}
\]

since \(Q^{-1}(y_i\vert\theta_i)=u_i\) and
\(f(y_i\vert\theta_i)=[q(u_i\vert\theta_i)]^{-1}\)
\citep{gilchrist2000StatisticalModellingQuantile}.

It's worth noting that this method of creating multivariate
distributions does not require every component to follow the same
distributional form. As illustrated earlier, it is entirely possible to
combine several different QPDs using the multivariate Gaussian
distribution \citep{drovandi2011LikelihoodfreeBayesianEstimation}.

To use the MQPD for the prior, both the density of the multivariate
normal and the marginal densities need to be explicitly added to the
log-likelihood. This is possible when the marginal QPDs used to define
the multivariate prior are invertible, such as Myerson and J-QPD, as
both the CDF \(Q^{-1}(y_i\vert\theta_i)\) and PDF
\(dQ^{-1}(y_i\vert\theta_i)/dy_i\) are required. When a quantile-based
prior specification is used, only the multivariate normal log-density
needs to be added because the Jacobian for the marginal QF
transformation is reciprocal to the DQF of the prior
\citep{perepolkin2023TenetsQuantilebasedInference}.

\subsubsection{Logistic distribution}\label{logistic-distribution}

The same approach of joining the marginal QPDs can be applied by using
the base quantile functions of other distributions. For instance, the
Logit-Myerson distribution \citep{wilson2023ReconciliationExpertPriors}
is based on the logistic quantile function. Two Logit-Myerson
distributions can be connected using the bivariate logistic
distribution. \citet{gumbel1961BivariateLogisticDistributions} proposed
three different formulations for the bivariate logistic distribution.
The Type II distribution from the Morgenstern family
\citep{sajeevkumar2014EstimationParameterMorgenstern, basikhasteh2021BayesianEstimationMorgenstern}
has the following joint distribution and density functions:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&F(y_1,y_2\vert\beta)=F_1(y_1)F_2(y_2)\times\\
&\quad \times \biggl[1+\beta\Bigl(1-F_1(y_1)\Bigr)\Bigl(1-F_2(y_2)\Bigr)\biggr]\\
&f(y_1,y_2\vert\beta)=f_1(y_1)f_2(y_2)\times\\
&\quad \times \biggl[1+\beta\Bigl(1-2F_1(y_1)\Bigr)\Bigl(1-2F_2(y_2)\Bigr)\biggr]
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(F_i(y_i)\) and \(f_i(y_i)\) for \(i\in\{1,2\}\) refer to the
univariate logistic distribution and density funcitons, respectively and
\(-1\leq\beta\leq1\). Since \(y_i=Q_i(u_i)\) we can express the
bivariate density in the quantile form

\[
\begin{gathered}
f\bigl[Q(u_1),Q(u_2)\vert\beta\bigr]=f_1\bigl[Q(u_1)\bigr]f_2\bigl[Q(u_2)\bigr]\times\\
\times \Bigl[1+\beta\bigl(1-2F_1\left[Q_1(u_1)\right]\bigr)\bigl(1-2F_2\left[Q_2(u_2)\right]\bigr)\Bigr]\\
\left[q(u_1,u_2\vert\beta)\right]^{-1}=[q_1(u_1)]^{-1}[q_2(u_2)]^{-1} \times\\
\times \Bigl[1+\beta \left(1-2u_1\right)\left(1-2u_2\right)\Bigr]
\end{gathered}
\]

For logistic distribution with \(Q(u)=\ln(u)-\ln(1-u)\) and
\([q(u)]^{-1}=u(1-u)\), the bivariate logistic density quantile function
can be expressed as

\[
\begin{gathered}
\left[q_L(u_1,u_2\vert\beta)\right]^{-1}=u_1(1-u_1)u_2(1-u_2)\times\\
\quad\times \Bigl[1+\beta (1-2u_1)(1-2u_2)\Bigr]
\end{gathered}
\]

If we combine the QPD marginals, the result is the joint quantile-based
density for the bivariate logistic-based QPD, where the dependency is
captured by the bivariate logistic distribution with the coupling
parameter \(\beta\), and the margins are QPDs. The joint density
quantile function is given by:

\[
\begin{gathered}
\left[q_{MQPD}(u_1,u_2\vert\theta_1,\theta_2, \beta)\right]^{-1}=\\
u_1(1-u_1)u_2(1-u_2)\times\\
\times\Bigl[1+\beta (1-2u_1)(1-2u_2)\Bigr]\times\\
\times [q_1(u_1\vert\theta_1)]^{-1}[q_2(u_2\vert\theta_2)]^{-1}
\end{gathered}
\]

where \([q_i(u_i\vert\theta_i)]^{-1}\), for \(i=1,2\), are the marginal
QPD density quantile functions, such as the density quantile function
(DQF) of the Logit-Myerson distribution (see Supplementary Materials).

}

\caption{\label{fig-bi-logitmyerson}Density of Generalized Myerson
distributions joined by Type II bivariate logistic distribution}

\end{figure}%

This way of constructing a bivariate distribution is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig-bi-logitmyerson} with the Bivariate Logit-Myerson
Distribution, parameterized by \(\Theta=\{\theta_1, \theta_2, \rho\}\),
where the marginal Myerson distributions are given by
\(y_{ij}=Q_j(z(u_{ij}),\theta_j)\) for \(j=1,2\), with parameter vectors
\(\theta_1=\{3,7,10;0.25\}\), \(\theta_2=\{1,10,20;0.1\}\), and the
dependence parameter \(\beta=0.6\).

\subsection{Copula-based MQPDs}\label{copula-based-mqpds}

The approach we have used so far is similar to constructing the joint
distribution using the Gaussian copula
\citep{hoff2007ExtendingRankLikelihood}. Copulas provide a general
approach to modeling joint distributions, separating the bivariate
dependence from the effects of marginal distributions
\citep{kurowicka2006UncertaintyAnalysisHigh}. The literature describes a
wide range of copulas
\citep{genest2007EverythingYouAlways, smith2013BayesianApproachesCopula, kurowicka2011DependenceModelingVine},
and new copulas can be created using generator functions
\citep{durrleman2000SimpleTransformationCopulas}. When a copula is used
to connect QPDs, the joint density is calculated as follows:

\[
\begin{gathered}
f_{MQPD}(y_1,y_2\vert \theta_1,\theta_2,\Xi)=\\
c\Bigl[F(y_1\vert\theta_1),F(y_2\vert\theta_2)\vert\Xi \Bigr]\times \\
\times f_1\left(y_1\vert\theta_1\right) f_2\left(y_2\vert\theta_2\right)
\end{gathered}
\]

where \(c[\cdot]\) represents the copula density function with parameter
\(\Xi\), and \(F(y_i\vert\theta_i)\) and \(f_i(y_i\vert\theta_i)\) are
the CDF and PDF of the marginal quantile-parameterized distributions,
respectively.

The same density can be expressed in a quantile-based form
\citep{perepolkin2023TenetsQuantilebasedInference}:

\[
\begin{gathered}\\
[q_{MQPD}(u_1,u_2\vert\theta, \Xi)]^{-1}=\\
c\bigl[u_1,u_2\vert\Xi\bigr]\times \\
\times [q_1(u_1\vert\theta_1)]^{-1}[q_2(u_2\vert\theta)]^{-1}
\end{gathered}
\]

where \(c[\cdot]\) is the copula density function with parameter
\(\Xi\), and \([q_i(u_i\vert\theta_i)]^{-1}\), for \(i=1,2\), are the
marginal DQFs of QPDs. Figure~\ref{fig-bc-myerson} presents 10,000
samples from the bivariate Myerson distribution joined by the Joe copula
with \(\theta=3\).

Elicitation of multivariate distributions may require a specialized
approach
\citep{elfadaly2017ElicitingDirichletGaussian, wilson2021RecentAdvancesElicitation}.
For examples of expert-specified multivariate distributions encoded with
copulas, we refer to the relevant literature
\citep{wilson2018SpecificationInformativePrior, holzhauer2022ElicitingJudgementsDependent, sharma2018RegularizationVariableSelection, aas2009PaircopulaConstructionsMultiple}.
When fitting copulas to empirical observations, the \emph{blanket}
goodness of fit measure \citep{wang2000ModelSelectionSemiparametric}
based on Kendall's transform
\citep{genest2006GoodnessofFitProceduresCopula, genest2009GoodnessoffitTestsCopulas}
can be used.

}

\caption{\label{fig-bc-myerson}Samples from the bivariate Myerson
distribution joined by the Joe copula (\(\theta=3\))}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Bivariate quantiles}\label{bivariate-quantiles}

The formal definition of bivariate quantile functions and the method for
constructing bivariate quantile distributions using marginal and
conditional quantile functions are provided by
\citet{nair2023PropertiesBivariateDistributions} and
\citet{vineshkumar2019BivariateQuantileFunctions}. They define the
bivarate quantile function (bQF) of \((X_1, X_2)\) as the pair
\(Q(u_1, u_2)=\bigl[Q_1(u_1), Q_{21}(u_2\vert u_1)\bigr]\), where
\(Q_1(u_1)=\inf \{x_1: F_1(x_1)\geq u_1\}\), \(u_1\in[0,1]\) and
\(Q_{21}(u_2\vert u_1)=\inf\{x_2: F_{21}(Q_1, x_2)\geq u_2\}\).

The conditional quantile function \(Q_{21}(u_2\vert u_1)\) can be
obtained by inverting the conditional distribution function
\(F_{21}(x_1, x_2)\), which is computed from the factorization of the
joint survival function. The joint survival function is defined as
\(\bar{F}(x_1, x_2)=P(X_1> x_1)P(X_2> x_2 \vert X_1 > x_1)= \bar{F}(x_1)\bar{F}_{21}(x_1,x_2)\).
Note that the joint survival function
\(\bar{F}(x_1,x_2)=1-F_1(x_1)-F_2(x_2)+F(x_1,x_2)\), and the conditional
survival function \(\bar{F}_{21}(x_1,x_2)=1-F_{21}(x_1,x_2)\).

Another approach for creating bivariate quantile functions is through
Gilchrist's QF transformation rules
\citep{gilchrist2000StatisticalModellingQuantile}, which can be
generalized to bivariate quantile functions. According to
\citet{nair2023PropertiesBivariateDistributions} (Property 6), the
conditional QF can be constructed as a sum of two univariate QFs:
\(Q_{21}(u_2\vert u_1) = Q_1(u_1) + Q_2(u_2)\). This means that the pair
\([Q_1(u_1) ; Q_1(u_1) + Q_2(u_2)]\) is a valid bivariate quantile
function, which generalizes Gilchrist's \emph{addition rule}
(Table~\ref{tbl-qf-trans}). The addition rule also works for quantile
density functions (Property 7). If \(Q_1\) is left-bounded at zero,
i.e., \(Q_1(0) = 0\), then the margins of such a bQF are
\(X_1 = Q_1(u_1)\) and \(X_2 = Q_2(u_2)\). Otherwise, the marginal
distribution of \(X_2\) will be
\(\lim_{u_1 \rightarrow 0}Q_{21}(u_2\vert u_1)\), which in many cases is
not tractable.

If \(Q_1(u_1)\) and \(Q_2(u_2)\) are positive on \(u_i \in [0,1]\), then
their product is also a valid conditional QF (Property 8), generalizing
Gilchrist's ``product rule''. Finally, Property 9 generalizes the
``Q-transformation rule,'' stating that for every increasing
transformation functions \(T_1\) and \(T_2\),
\(\Bigl[T_1(Q_1(u_1)), T_1(Q_1(u_1)) + T_2(Q_2(u_2))\Bigr]\) is also a
valid bQF.

Therefore, valid bivariate quantile-parameterized QFs can be created by
constructing the conditional quantile functions as Gilchrist
combinations of univariate quantile-parameterized QFs.
Figure~\ref{fig-bq-myerson} shows 1000 samples from the bivariate
distribution created by adding together two Myerson distributions. Note
that in this case, only the marginal distribution of \(x_1 = Q_1(u_1)\)
is available in closed form.

\[
\begin{aligned}
(u_1, u_2) &\overset{X_1, X_2}{\backsim} [Q_1(u_1), Q_1(u_1)+Q_2(u_2)]\\
Q_1(u_1) &\sim\text{Myerson}(3,7,10; 0.1)\\
Q_2(u_2) &\sim \text{Myerson}(-9, -3, 2; 0.25)\\
\end{aligned}
\]

This bQF is easy to elicit and interpret, since \(Q_2(u_2)\) can be
thought of as a random adjustment to the value of \(Q_1(u_1)\). In fact,
the conditional quantile function \(Q_{21}(u_2\vert u_1)\) can be
thought of as having the classical form
\(Q_{21}(u_2\vert u_1) = \mu(u_1) + \sigma Q_2(u_2)\)
\citep{gilchrist2000StatisticalModellingQuantile}, where the location is
randomly varying with \(\mu(u_1) = Q_1(u_1)\) and the scale parameter
\(\sigma = 1\). First, the marginal distribution \(Q_1(u_1)\) is
elicited, and then the difference between the values \(x_1\) and \(x_2\)
can be elicited as a QPT and encoded as \(Q_2(u_2)\).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Quantile-based distributions have garnered significant attention in the
research community. Several distributions, such as the Generalized
Lambda Distribution (GLD)
\citep{freimer1988StudyGeneralizedTukey, ramberg1974ApproximateMethodGenerating},
the g-and-k distribution
\citep{haynes1997RobustnessRankingSelection, haynes2005BayesianEstimationGandk, prangle2017GkPackageGandk},
the g-and-h distribution
\citep{field2006MultivariateGandhDistribution, macgillivray1992ShapePropertiesGandh, rayner2002NumericalMaximumLikelihood},
and the Wakeby distribution
\citep{jeong-soo2005WakebyDistributionMaximum, rahman2015ApplicabilityWakebyDistribution, tarsitano2005FittingWakebyModel},
have been extensively studied and documented in the literature. These
distributions are defined by non-invertible quantile functions
\citep{perepolkin2023TenetsQuantilebasedInference}. However, the
research on quantile-parameterized distributions remains relatively
unexplored. These distributions offer interpretable parameters that are
defined on the same scale as the quantities of interest, simplifying the
elicitation process for experts. Many popular elicitation protocols for
both predictive and parametric elicitation rely on the assessment of
quantile-probability pairs (QPPs). Instead of fitting a parametric
distribution to the elicited QPPs
\citep{best2020PriorElicitation, ohagan2019ExpertKnowledgeElicitation},
assessors could directly use the elicited QPPs as inputs into one of the
QPD quantile functions, which can be easily employed in both
quantile-parameterized and parametric models.

Provided that the expert and the elicitor agree on the scientific model
to be used for representing the expert's understanding of the world
\citep{burgman2021ElicitingModelStructures}, several types of inputs may
be required to inform the model. Among those are the expert's judgement
about the model \emph{parameters}
\citep{mikkola2021PriorKnowledgeElicitation, ohagan2019ExpertKnowledgeElicitation}
and their \emph{predictions} of the next observation
\citep{akbarov2009ProbabilityElicitationPredictive, kadane1998ExperiencesElicitation, winkler1980PriorInformationPredictive}.
Both parametric and predictive judgments should be captured together
with corresponding uncertainties to reflect the expert's state of
knowledge.

Quantile-parameterized distributions offer distinct advantages as
high-fidelity priors that precisely capture expert assessments. These
distributions are particularly beneficial for domain experts who may not
be well-versed in statistics, as they provide high flexibility while
retaining parameter interpretability. As a result, QPDs can faithfully
represent an expert's beliefs without compromising convenience or
precision.

\textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{Quantile-parameterized distributions with
unbounded support do not control the heaviness of the tail beyond the
most extreme quantile specified. Therefore,} different QPDs fitted to
the same set of quantile-probability pairs may exhibit slight variations
in shape. \textcolor[HTML]{ff0000}{The tail heaviness of such
distributions is determined by the parametric \emph{kernel} distribution
underlying the quantile parameterization.} However, given the diverse
range of QPDs proposed in the literature a knowledgeable assessor should
be able to select an appropriate distribution and validate the choice
with the expert, taking into account the thickness of the distribution
tails.

Most QPDs we reviewed are parameterized by a symmetric percentile
triplet (SPT). These distributions rely on the symmetric property of
underlying \emph{kernel} distributions and can be generalized by
swapping the distribution with another one that exhibits different tail
shapes. \citet{hadlock2019GeneralizedJohnsonQuantileParameterized}
utilized this method to generalize Johnson Quantile Parameterized
distributions (J-QPDs). We show that the variants of Myerson
distribution appearing in the literature
\citep{myerson2005ProbabilityModelsEconomic, wilson2023ReconciliationExpertPriors}
represent similar generalization. This principle can be extended to
include other kernels which result in varying thickness of the tails.

\subsubsection*{Quantile function
perspective}\label{quantile-function-perspective}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Quantile function perspective}

The distributions discussed in this paper are defined using the quantile
function and, therefore, they can be considered \emph{quantile-based}
quantile-parameterized distributions. Myerson, J-QPD, and several other
quantile-parameterized distributions reparameterize conventional
distributions, utilizing Gilchrist's transformations
(Table~\ref{tbl-qf-trans}).

\citet{perepolkin2023TenetsQuantilebasedInference} demonstrated that the
distributions defined by quantile function can be used both as prior and
as likelihood in Bayesian models. Priors defined by quantile function
eliminate the need to compute prior density. The quantile function acts
as a non-linear transformation of a uniform degenerate random variate
with the resulting Jacobian adjustment reciprocal to the density
quantile function. Therefore, both the Jacobian and the density quantile
function are omitted from the Bayesian updating equation
\citep{perepolkin2023TenetsQuantilebasedInference}. When using
quantile-based QPDs as likelihood, special care needs to be taken with
regards to the suitable prior for the QPP parameters.
\citet{perepolkin2024HybridElicitationQuantileparametrized} used the
Dirichet-based prior for the metalog likelihood model and descibed the
\emph{hybrid} elicitation process for encoding the expert judgments into
the two-dimensional prior distribution implied by the model.
Alternatively, \citet{wilson2023ReconciliationExpertPriors} used
multivariate normal distribution for the interquantile distances. This
approach requires specification of the covariance structure, which might
be difficult to elicit.

Not all QPDs are equally reliable in approximating the underlying
distributions. Violating the QF transformation rules imposes additional
constraints on the feasibility of parameters, as certain combinations of
parameters may result in locally decreasing quantile functions
\citep{keelin2016MetalogDistributions, hadlock2017QuantileparameterizedMethodsQuantifying}.

\subsubsection*{Multivariate extensions}\label{multivariate-extensions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Multivariate extensions}

Quantile-parameterized distributions can be readily extended to the
multivariate setting by leveraging traditional multivariate
distributions. The combination of quantile-based marginal distributions
joined by the multivariate normal has been previously discussed in the
literature
\citep{drovandi2011LikelihoodfreeBayesianEstimation, hoff2007ExtendingRankLikelihood}.
Building on this approach, we proposed the use of Gumbel's bivariate
logistic distribution \citep{gumbel1961BivariateLogisticDistributions}
to combine quantile-parameterized Logit-Myerson distributions
\citep{wilson2023ReconciliationExpertPriors}.

Copulas offer a natural extension of univariate QPDs into the
multivariate domain. Bivariate copulas can be assembled into more
complex structures using vine copulas
\citep{czado2019AnalyzingDependentData, kurowicka2011DependenceModelingVine, wilson2018SpecificationInformativePrior}.
Flexible QPDs serve as a viable alternative to empirical copulas, where
the margins are represented by kernel density estimation (KDE) or other
non-parametric approaches. Poorly fitted marginal distributions mean
\emph{less-than-ideal} starting point for copula modeling, due to
potential deviations from uniformality of the copula margins.

Quantile-parameterized distributions defined by quantile function are
particularly well-suited for constructing new distributions using
bivariate quantiles
\citep{nair2023PropertiesBivariateDistributions, vineshkumar2019BivariateQuantileFunctions}.
The ability to construct a conditional quantile function as a linear
combination of univariate quantile functions offers a convenient and
interpretable approach to defining bivariate distributions, especially
when the univariate quantile functions are parameterized by quantiles.
These distributions are easy to sample from and construct. However,
fitting these distributions to data can be challenging. As shown by
\citet{castillo1997FittingContinuousBivariate} the fitting process
requires all marginal and conditional quantile functions to be available
in closed form, which is often unattainable.

\subsubsection*{Further research}\label{further-research}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Further research}

There appears to be a limited availability of unbounded
quantile-parameterized distributions in the current literature. Among
the distributions we examined, only the metalog distribution can extend
across the entire real line. The G-QPD system provides clear
distributional bounds explicitly defined by the expert during
elicitation. In contrast, the (Generalized) Myerson distribution system
relies on implicit bounds that need to be communicated to the expert.
Most of the distributions we reviewed are characterized by a symmetrical
percentile triplet (SPT), as they rely on the symmetrical property of
their kernels. However, there may be situations where an arbitrary
(non-symmetrical) quantile parameterization could prove valuable
\citep[as shown
by][]{perepolkin2024HybridElicitationQuantileparametrized}. The
development of flexible quantile-parameterized distributions defined by
an arbitrary set of quantile-probability pairs can enhance versatility
of QPDs and facilitate their broader adoption.

In conclusion, quantile-parameterized distributions offer a valuable
framework for capturing expert assessments and incorporating them into
statistical models. They provide high flexibility and parameter
interpretability, making them particularly beneficial for domain
experts. The diverse range of quantile-parameterized distributions
explored in the literature allows for customized modeling approaches
that align with the expert's beliefs and uncertainties. By embracing
these innovative distributions, researchers and practitioners can
enhance the accuracy and reliability of their statistical models while
leveraging expert knowledge effectively.
