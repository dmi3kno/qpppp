  abstract = {We investigate the generalized lambda distribution with infinite support as an alternative distribution for modeling financial return series with power law tails. We derive expressions for the distribution, for random number generation, and for financial risk measures including value at risk, expected shortfall and tail indices. We introduce a new robust moment approach for the estimation of the distribution parameters based on the median, inter- quartile range, Bowley's skewness and Moors' kurtosis. In addition using a Monte Carlo approach we explore the use of several estimation approaches including maximum log likelihood, maximum product spacing, goodness of fit testing, and histogram binning. A new four-parameter parameterization allows an intuitive interpretation based on the asymmetry and the tail be- haviour of the distribution. We also introduce a new method of obtaining parameter estimates in which the data is standardized to have zero median and unit interquartile range and then a generalized lambda distribution with zero median and unit interquartile range is fitted to the data. This reduces the number of parameters to two allowing for more efficient parameter esti mation.},

  abstract = {The metalog distributions constitute a new system of continuous univariate probability distributions designed for flexibility, simplicity, and ease/speed of use in practice. The system is comprised of unbounded, semibounded, and bounded distributions, each of which offers nearly unlimited shape flexibility compared to previous systems of distributions. Explicit shape-flexibility comparisons are provided. Unlike other distributions that require nonlinear optimization for parameter estimation, the metalog quantile functions and probability density functions have simple closed-form expressions that are quantile parameterized linearly by cumulative-distribution-function data. Applications in fish biology and hydrology show how metalogs may aid data and distribution research by imposing fewer shape constraints than other commonly used distributions. Applications in decision analysis show how the metalog system can be specified with three assessed quantiles, how it facilities Monte Carlo simulation, and how applying it aided an actual decision that would have been made wrongly based on commonly used discrete methods.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
