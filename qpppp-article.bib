  abstract = {Building on the work of Bedford, Cooke and Joe, we show how multivariate data, which exhibit complex patterns of dependence in the tails, can be modelled using a cascade of pair-copulae, acting on two variables at a time. We use the pair-copula decomposition of a general multivariate distribution and propose a method for performing inference. The model construction is hierarchical in nature, the various levels corresponding to the incorporation of more variables in the conditioning sets, using pair-copulae as simple building blocks. Pair-copula decomposed models also represent a very flexible way to construct higher-dimensional copulae. We apply the methodology to a financial data set. Our approach represents the first step towards the development of an unsupervised algorithm that explores the space of possible pair-copula models, that also can be applied to huge data sets automatically.},

  abstract = {Probability elicitation is an important area of research with a wide scope for investigation and experimentation. The existing literature on the subject is vast and spread over many disciplines. This indicates the importance of the subject and the ubiquitous nature of the concept of probability. In this thesis, we focus on a probability elicitation method known as predictive elicitation. Predictive elicitation is a method for estimating hyperparameters of prior distributions by inverting corresponding prior predictive distributions. The uncertainty associated with prior predictive distributions is the uncertainty associated with socalled observable quantities. This uncertainty is generally accepted to be fundamentally more robust for elicitation than the uncertainty about unobservable parameters associated with prior distributions. Although predictive elicitation is the most natural way for eliciting probabilities for Bayesian models, it has two major difficulties for practical implementation. The first of these difficulties is related to inverting integral equations. Here, we deal with this difficulty by restricting the space of possible classes of prior distributions into three families, namely the beta, gamma and normal families as suggested by Percy (2002- 2004). The second difficulty is the problem of constraints on eliciting quantiles of the prior predictive distribution. In this thesis, we propose a method for identifying such constraints for single parameter models. We also propose a computational algorithm that makes predictive elicitation accessible for two-parameter models. We demonstrate that using the proposed elicitation method for two-parameter models it is possible to identify associated constraints. In summary, we extend the current literature related to predictive elicitation by adding to it the following main points: We propose a method for identifying constraints on the elicitation of quantiles for single parameter models. We propose the use of a new hybrid elicitation procedure for two-parameter models. We also investigate a method for identifying constraints on the elicitation process posed by the hybrid elicitation strategy. We provide numerical algorithms, programmed using MathCAD software, that enable full implementation of predictive elicitation for single parameter models. We also provide similar programs for selected two-parameter models that enable implementation of the proposed hybrid elicitation method. These algorithms can be used as bases for developing generic software for implementing predictive elicitation. Further research is needed to address the issue of the practical applicability of predictive elicitation to multi-parameter and multivariate models. The advancements made in this thesis provide foundations and an approach for dealing with the problem of constraints that can be extended to solve similar problems for multi-parameter and multivariate models.},

However, since it is based on the sample mean and standard deviation, outliers can adversely affect it. Additionally, for skewed distributions the mean and standard deviation may be difficult to interpret and, consequently, that may also be the case for the CV. Here we investigate the extent to which quantile-based measures of relative dispersion can provide appropriate summary information as an alternative to the CV. In particular, we investigate two measures, the first being the interquartile range (in lieu of the standard deviation), divided by the median (in lieu of the mean), and the second being the median absolute deviation, divided by the median, as robust estimators of relative dispersion. In addition to comparing the influence functions of the competing estimators and their asymptotic biases and variances, we compare interval estimators using simulation studies to assess coverage.},

  abstract = {Notionally objective probabilistic risk models, built around ideas of cause and effect, are used to predict impacts and evaluate trade-offs. In this paper, we focus on the use of expert judgement to fill gaps left by insufficient data and understanding. Psychological and contextual phenomena such as anchoring, availability bias, confirmation bias and overconfidence are pervasive and have powerful effects on individual judgements. Research across a range of fields has found that groups have access to more diverse information and ways of thinking about problems, and routinely outperform credentialled individuals on judgement and prediction tasks. In structured group elicitation, individuals make initial independent judgements, opinions are respected, participants consider the judgements made by others, and they may have the opportunity to reconsider and revise their initial estimates. Estimates may be aggregated using behavioural, mathematical or combined approaches. In contrast, mathematical modelers have been slower to accept that the host of psychological frailties and contextual biases that afflict judgements about parameters and events may also influence model assumptions and structures. Few, if any, quantitative risk analyses embrace sources of uncertainty comprehensively. However, several recent innovations aim to anticipate behavioural and social biases in model construction and to mitigate their effects. In this paper, we outline approaches to eliciting and combining alternative ideas of cause and effect. We discuss the translation of ideas into equations and assumptions, assessing the potential for psychological and social factors to affect the construction of models. We outline the strengths and weaknesses of recent advances in structured, group-based model construction that may accommodate a variety of understandings about cause and effect.},

Let X and Y be bivariate random variables with cumulative distribut ion function (CDF) F(x, y; {\texttheta}) where {\texttheta} is an unknown, possibly vector-valued, parameter. To estimate {\texttheta} on the basis of an observed random sample from F(x, y; {\texttheta}), we first express the predicted values of the random variables as functions of {\texttheta}; then an estimate of {\texttheta} is obtained by minimizing the sum of the squares of the distances between the observed and predicted values. In the univariate case, this is straightforward because the inverse of the CDF is a single point, but in the bivariate case the inverse is a surface. We present ways for expressing the predicted values in the bivariate case as a function of {\texttheta}. The idea is to use the joint and marginal CDFs as the basis for calculating the predicted values as functions of {\texttheta}, thereby extending the univariate to the bivariate case. The method is illustrated by applications to several bivariate distributions such as the bivariate logistic, Pareto and exponential distributions. Simulation results indicate that the method performs well. The method is also applied to an example of real data. Finally, we briefly discuss possible extensions to the multivariate case},

In addition using a Monte Carlo approach we explore the use of several estimation approaches including maximum log likelihood, maximum product spacing, goodness of fit testing, and histogram binning. A new four-parameter parameterization allows an intuitive interpretation based on the asymmetry and the tail be- haviour of the distribution. We also introduce a new method of obtaining parameter estimates in which the data is standardized to have zero median and unit interquartile range and then a generalized lambda distribution with zero median and unit interquartile range is fitted to the data. This reduces the number of parameters to two allowing for more efficient parameter esti mation.},

Furthermore, we present a framework for the development of multivariate quantile distributions based on a copula. We consider bivariate and time series extensions of the g-and-k distribution under this framework, and develop an efficient component-wise updating scheme free of likelihood functions to be used within the SMC algorithm. In addition, we trial the set of octiles as summary statistics as well as functions of these that form robust measures of location, scale, skewness and kurtosis. We show that these modifications lead to reasonably precise inferences that are more closely comparable to computationally intensive likelihood-based inference. We apply the quantile distributions and algorithms to simulated data and an example involving daily exchange rate returns.},

  abstract = {Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Plant Health performed a risk assessment of Citripestis sagittiferella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), the citrus pulp borer, an oligophagous pest reported from South-East Asia and restricted to Citrus spp. The entry risk assessment focused on the citrus fruit pathway. Two scenarios were considered: scenario A0 (current practice) and A2 (additional post-harvest cold treatment). Based on the outputs of the entry model obtained in scenario A0, the median number of founder populations in the EU citrus-growing area is estimated to be slightly less than 10 per year (90\%-uncertainty interval between about one entry per 180 years and 1,300 entries per year). The risk of entry and the simulated numbers of founder populations are orders of magnitude lower for scenario A2 compared to scenario A0. The key uncertainties in the entry model include transfer, the cold treatment effectiveness, the disaggregation factor and sorting. The simulated numbers of established populations are only slightly lower than the numbers of founder populations. As the probability of establishment has little impact on the number of established populations, it is not a major source of uncertainty, despite the lack of data on the thermal biology of the pest. The median lag period between establishment and spread is estimated to be slightly more than 1 year (90\%-uncertainty interval between about 2 months and 33 months). After the lag period, the median spread rate by natural means (flying) and due to transport of harvested citrus fruit from orchards to packinghouses is estimated at about 100 km/year (90\%-uncertainty interval between about 40 and 500 km/year). The main sources of uncertainties affecting the spread rate include the extent to which environmental factors could hamper the build-up of the populations and the lack of data on the spread rate at the origin. The median impact of C. sagittiferella in the EU citrus-growing area is estimated at about 10\% of infested fruits among the harvested citrus fruits (90\%-uncertainty interval between about 2\% and 25\%). Uncertainties affecting the impact assessment include the susceptibility of different Citrus species and cultivars.},

Two different multivariate priors are elicited using median and quartile assessments of the multinomial probabilities. First, we start by eliciting a univariate beta distribution for the probability of each category. Then we elicit the hyperparameters of the Dirichlet distribution, as a tractable conjugate prior, from those of the univariate betas through various forms of reconciliation using least-squares techniques. However, a multivariate copula function will give a more flexible correlation structure between multinomial parameters if it is used as their multivariate prior distribution. So, second, we use beta marginal distributions to construct a Gaussian copula as a multivariate normal distribution function that binds these marginals and expresses the dependence structure between them. The proposed method elicits a positive-definite correlation matrix of this Gaussian copula. The two proposed methods are designed to be used through interactive graphical software written in Java.},

It surprisingly emerges that there was no emphasis in Pearson's papers on kurtosis as measuring (in part) tail heaviness. However, it is found that Pearson used to frequently adjust the formalisation of kurtosis depending on his changing needs. This complex development partly explains the confusion that would surround kurtosis in subsequent literature. Our conclusion is that most misunderstandings arise from improper use of the kurtosis coefficient outside the Pearson system of frequency curves.},

Their procedure is based on a truncated version of the Kendall process introduced by Genest \& Rivest [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 88 (1993) 1034] and later studied by Barbe et al. [J. Multivariate Anal. 58 (1996) 197]. Although Wang \& Wells (2000) determine the asymptotic behaviour of their truncated process, their model selection method is based exclusively on the observed value of its L\textsuperscript{2}-norm. This paper shows how to compute asymptotic p-values for various goodness-of-fit test statistics based on a non-truncated version of Kendall's process. Conditions for weak convergence are met in the most common copula models, whether Archimedean or not. The empirical behaviour of the proposed goodness-of-fit tests is studied by simulation, and power comparisons are made with a test proposed by Shih [Biometrika 85 (1998) 189] for the gamma frailty family.},

  abstract = {In decision analysis, analysts must often encode an expert's uncertainty of a quantity (e.g., the volume of oil reserves in a proven, but undeveloped oil field) using a probability distribution. This is commonly done by eliciting a triplet of low-base-high percentile assessments, such as the \{10th, 50th, 90th\} percentiles, from the expert, and then fitting a probability distribution from a well-known family (e.g., lognormal) to the assessed quantile-probability (or QP) pairs. However, curve fitting often requires non-linear, non-convex optimization over a distribution parameter space, and the fitted distribution often never honors the assessed QP pairs -- reducing both the fidelity of the model, and trust in the analysis. The development of quantile-parameterized distributions (or QPDs), distributions that are parameterized by, and thus precisely honor the assessed QP pairs, is a very important yet nascent topic in decision analysis, and contributions in the literature are sparse. This dissertation extends existing work on QPDs by strategically developing a new smooth probability distribution system (known as J-QPD) that is parameterized by (and honors) assessed QP pairs. J-QPD also honors various natural support regimes -- for example: bounded (e.g., fractional uncertainties, such as market shares, are necessarily bounded between zero and one); semi-bounded (e.g., volume of oil reserves is necessarily non-negative, but may have no well-defined upper bound); etc. We then show that J-QPD is maximally-feasible, highly flexible, and approximates the shapes of a vast array of commonly-named distributions (e.g., normal, lognormal, beta, etc.) with potent accuracy, using a single system. This work also presents efficient, high-fidelity methods for capturing dependence between two or more uncertainties by combining J-QPD with modern correlation assessment and modeling techniques. We then provide an application of J-QPD to a famous decision analysis example, demonstrating how J-QPD facilitates rapid Monte Carlo simulation, and how its implementation can aid actual decisions that might otherwise be made wrongly if commonly-used discrete methods are used. We conclude by noting important tradeoffs between J-QPD and existing QPD systems, and offer several extensions for future research, including a first look at designing new discrete distributions using J-QPD.},

We also show how to augment the SPT/bound parameters with a tail parameter, lending separate control over the distribution body and tail.

However, specifying suitable priors is often difficult even when detailed prior knowledge is available in principle. The challenge is to express quantitative information in the form of a probability distribution. Prior elicitation addresses this question by extracting subjective information from an expert and transforming it into a valid prior. Most existing methods, however, require information to be provided on the unobservable parameters, whose effect on the data generating process is often complicated and hard to understand. We propose an alternative approach that only requires knowledge about the observable outcomes -- knowledge which is often much easier for experts to provide. Building upon a principled statistical framework, our approach utilizes the prior predictive distribution implied by the model to automatically transform experts judgements about plausible outcome values to suitable priors on the parameters. We also provide computational strategies to perform inference and guidelines to facilitate practical use.},

One approach to the analysis of such mixed data is to use a copula model, in which the associations among the variables are parameterized separately from their univariate marginal distributions. The purpose of this article is to provide a simple, general method of semiparametric inference for copula models via a type of rank likelihood function for the association parameters. The proposed method of inference can be viewed as a generalization of marginal likelihood estimation, in which inference for a parameter of interest is based on a summary statistic whose sampling distribution is not a function of any nuisance parameters. In the context of copula estimation, the extended rank likelihood is a function of the association parameters only and its applicability does not depend on any assumptions about the marginal distributions of the data, thus making it appropriate for the analysis of mixed continuous and discrete data with arbitrary marginal distributions. Estimation and inference for parameters of the Gaussian copula are available via a straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on Gibbs sampling. Specification of prior distributions or a parametric form for the univariate marginal distributions of the data is not necessary.},

In this situation, eliciting the judgements of experts is an attractive approach for synthesising evidence on the unknown quantities of interest. When calculating the probability of success for a drug development program, multiple quantities of interest---such as the effect of a drug on different endpoints---should not be treated as unrelated. We discuss two approaches for establishing a multivariate distribution for several related quantities within the SHeffield ELicitation Framework (SHELF). The first approach elicits experts' judgements about a quantity of interest conditional on knowledge about another one. For the second approach, we first elicit marginal distributions for each quantity of interest. Then, for each pair of quantities, we elicit the concordance probability that both lie on the same side of their respective elicited medians. This allows us to specify a copula to obtain the joint distribution of the quantities of interest. We show how these approaches were used in an elicitation workshop that was performed to assess the probability of success of the registrational program of an asthma drug. The judgements of the experts, which were obtained prior to completion of the pivotal studies, were well aligned with the final trial results.},

Newton-Raphson's root-finding routine and a nonlinear numerical optimization algorithm with constraint (so-called feasible sequential quadratic programming) are used. This algorithm is applied to the Wakeby distribution which is importantly used in hydrology and water resource research for analysis of extreme rainfall. The performance comparison between maximum likelihood estimates and method of L-moment estimates (L-ME) is studied by Monte-carlo simulation. The recommended methods are L-ME for up to 300 observations and MLE for over the sample size, respectively. Methods for speeding up the algorithm and for computing variances of estimates are discussed.},

Unfortunately, the beta distribution is not easily understood and its parameters are not easily estimated. This paper explores the possibility of using the more intuitively obvious triangular distribution as a proxy for the beta distribution. It is shown that the differences between the two distribution functions are seldom significant and a procedure is proposed for estimating the parameters of a triangular distribution on the basis of two extreme percentiles and the median},

In this article, we concentrate mainly on quantile-based measures of kurtosis and their interaction with skewness-inducing transformations, identifying classes of transformations that leave kurtosis measures invariant. Further miscellaneous aspects of skewness-invariant kurtosis measures are briefly considered, these not being quantile-based and/or not involving transformations. While our treatment is as unified as we are able to make it, we do not claim anything like a complete characterization of skewness-invariant kurtosis measures but hope that our results will stimulate further research into the issue.},

In many such cases, the nature of the uncertainty is more naturally characterized by quantiles than by parameters of familiar continuous probability distributions. In the practice of decision analysis, it is common to fit a hand-drawn curve to quantile outputs from probability elicitations on a continuous uncertain quantity and to then discretize the curve. The resulting discrete probability distribution is an approximation that cuts off the distribution's tails and eliminates intermediate values. Quantile-parameterized distributions address this problem by using quantiles themselves to parameterize a continuous probability distribution. We define quantile-parameterized distributions, illustrate their flexibility and range of applicability, and conclude with practical considerations when parameterizing distributions using inconsistent quantile assessments.},

The system is comprised of unbounded, semibounded, and bounded distributions, each of which offers nearly unlimited shape flexibility compared to previous systems of distributions. Explicit shape-flexibility comparisons are provided. Unlike other distributions that require nonlinear optimization for parameter estimation, the metalog quantile functions and probability density functions have simple closed-form expressions that are quantile parameterized linearly by cumulative-distribution-function data. Applications in fish biology and hydrology show how metalogs may aid data and distribution research by imposing fewer shape constraints than other commonly used distributions. Applications in decision analysis show how the metalog system can be specified with three assessed quantiles, how it facilities Monte Carlo simulation, and how applying it aided an actual decision that would have been made wrongly based on commonly used discrete methods.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

Often, it is unclear which traditional probability distribution(s) to use, fitting to data is laborious and unsatisfactory, little insight emerges, and updating with Bayes rule is impractical.  Here we offer an alternative -- a family of continuous probability distributions, fitting methods, and tools that: provide sufficient shape and boundedness flexibility to closely match virtually any probability distribution or data set; involve a single set of simple closed-form equations; stimulate potentially valuable insights when applied to empirical data; are simply fit to data with ordinary least squares; are easy to combine in closed form when weighting the opinion of multiple experts; and, under certain conditions, are easily updated in closed form according to Bayes rule when new data becomes available. The Bayesian updating method is presented in a way that is readily understandable as a fisherman updates his catch probabilities when changing the river on which he fishes. While metalog applications have been shown to improve decision-making, the methods and results herein are broadly applicable to virtually any use of continuous probability in any field of human endeavor. Diverse data sets may be explored and modeled in these new ways with freely available spreadsheets and tools.},

This stylized fact has been supported by a vast collection of empirical studies. Given that the conventional measures of skewness and kurtosis are computed as an average and that averages are not robust, we ask: ``How useful are the measures of skewness and kurtosis used in previous empirical studies?'' To answer this question, we provide a survey of robust measures of skewness and kurtosis from the statistics literature and carry out extensive Monte Carlo simulations that compare the conventional measures with the robust measures of our survey. An application of the robust measures to daily S\&P500 index data indicates that the stylized facts might have been accepted too readily. We suggest that looking beyond the standard skewness and kurtosis measures can provide deeper and more accurate insight into market returns behavior.},

In practice, however, we are still fairly far from having usable prior elicitation tools that could significantly influence the way we build probabilistic models in academia and industry. We lack elicitation methods that integrate well into the Bayesian workflow and perform elicitation efficiently in terms of costs of time and effort. We even lack a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding different facets of the prior elicitation problem. Why are we not widely using prior elicitation? We analyze the state of the art by identifying a range of key aspects of prior knowledge elicitation, from properties of the modelling task and the nature of the priors to the form of interaction with the expert. The existing prior elicitation literature is reviewed and categorized in these terms. This allows recognizing under-studied directions in prior elicitation research, finally leading to a proposal of several new avenues to improve prior elicitation methodology.},

A number of key issues are discussed, including topics on which there are, and are not, experts who have knowledge that provides a basis for making informed predictive judgments; the inadequacy of only using qualitative uncertainty language; the role of cognitive heuristics and of overconfidence; the choice of experts; the development, refinement, and iterative testing of elicitation protocols that are designed to help experts to consider systematically all relevant knowledge when they make their judgments; the treatment of uncertainty about model functional form; diversity of expert opinion; and when it does or does not make sense to combine judgments from different experts. Although it may be tempting to view expert elicitation as a low-cost, low-effort alternative to conducting serious research and analysis, it is neither. Rather, expert elicitation should build on and use the best available research and analysis and be undertaken only when, given those, the state of knowledge will remain insufficient to support timely informed assessment and decision making.},

Indeed, there is essentially no aspect of scientific investigation in which judgment is not required. Judgment is necessarily subjective, but should be made as carefully, as objectively, and as scientifically as possible.Elicitation of expert knowledge concerning an uncertain quantity expresses that knowledge in the form of a (subjective) probability distribution for the quantity. Such distributions play an important role in statistical inference (for example as prior distributions in a Bayesian analysis) and in evidence-based decision-making (for example as expressions of uncertainty regarding inputs to a decision model). This article sets out a number of practices through which elicitation can be made as rigorous and scientific as possible.One such practice is to follow a recognized protocol that is designed to address and minimize the cognitive biases that experts are prone to when making probabilistic judgments. We review the leading protocols in the field, and contrast their different approaches to dealing with these biases through the medium of a detailed case study employing the SHELF protocol.The article ends with discussion of how to elicit a joint probability distribution for multiple uncertain quantities, which is a challenge for all the leading protocols. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

To encode uncertainty in the quantiles elicited from experts, we propose a Bayesian model based on the metalog distribution and a version of the Dirichlet prior.

The simulation study and real-world data for regression, classification, and large time-series data show that the `copula prior' often outperforms the lasso and elastic net while having a comparable sparsity of representation. Also, the copula prior encourages a grouping effect. The strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model collectively under the copula prior. The `copula prior' is a generic method, which can be used to define the new prior distribution. The application of copulas in modeling prior distribution for Bayesian methodology has not been explored much.

  abstract = {Copula models have become one of the most widely used tools in the applied modelling of multivariate data. Similarly, Bayesian methods are increasingly used to obtain efficient likelihood-based inference. However, to date, there has been only limited use of Bayesian approaches in the formulation and estimation of copula models. This article aims to address this shortcoming in two ways. First, to introduce copula models and aspects of copula theory that are especially relevant for a Bayesian analysis. Second, to outline Bayesian approaches to formulating and estimating copula models, and their advantages over alternative methods. Copulas covered include Archimedean, copulas constructed by inversion, and vine copulas; along with their interpretation as transformations. A number of parameterisations of a correlation matrix of a Gaussian copula are considered, along with hierarchical priors that allow for Bayesian selection and model averaging for each parameterisation. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes for fitting Gaussian and D-vine copulas, with and without selection, are given in detail. The relationship between the prior for the parameters of a D-vine, and the prior for a correlation matrix of a Gaussian copula, is discussed. Last, it is shown how to compute Bayesian inference when the data are discrete-valued using data augmentation. This approach generalises popular Bayesian methods for the estimation of models for multivariate binary and other ordinal data to more general copula models. Bayesian data augmentation has substantial advantages over other methods of estimation for this class of models.},

The more-or-less elicitation (MOLE) process takes insights from how biases affect people's decisions to design an elicitation process to mitigate or eliminate bias. MOLE relies on four, key insights: (1) uncertainty regarding the location of estimates means people can be unwilling to exclude values they would not specifically include; (2) repeated estimates can be averaged to produce a better, final estimate; (3) people are better at relative than absolute judgements; and, (4) consideration of multiple values prevents anchoring on a particular number. MOLE achieves these by having people repeatedly choose between options presented to them by the computerized tool rather than making estimates directly, and constructing a range logically consistent with (i.e., not ruled out by) the person's choices in the background. Herein, MOLE is compared, across four experiments, with eight elicitation processes---all requiring direct estimation of values---and is shown to greatly reduce overconfidence in estimated ranges and to generate best guesses that are more accurate than directly estimated equivalents. This is demonstrated across three domains---in perceptual and epistemic uncertainty and in a forecasting task.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, we consider the problem of the elicitation and specification of an uncertainty distribution based on expert judgements, which may be a subjective prior distribution in a Bayesian analysis, for a set of probabilities which are constrained to sum to one. A typical context for this is as a prior distribution for the probabilities in a multinomial model. The Dirichlet distribution has long been advocated as a natural way to represent the uncertainty distribution over the probabilities in this context. The relatively small number of parameters allows for specification based on relatively few elicited quantities but at the expense of a very restrictive structure. We detail recent advances in elicitation for the Dirichlet distribution and recently proposed alternative approaches, which offer greater flexibility at the expense of added complexity. In order of increasing flexibility, they are the generalised Dirichlet distribution, multivariate copulas and vines. An extension of multinomial models containing covariates is discussed.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of aggregating the judgements of a group of experts to form a single prior distribution representing the judgements of the group. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to reconcile the judgements of the group of experts based on elicited quantiles for continuous quantities and probabilities for one-off events. Previous Bayesian reconciliation methods have not been used widely, if at all, in contrast to pooling methods and consensus-based approaches. To address this we embed Bayesian reconciliation within the probabilistic Delphi method. The result is to furnish the outcome of the probabilistic Delphi method with a direct probabilistic interpretation, with the resulting prior representing the judgements of the decision maker. We can use the rationales from the Delphi process to group the experts for the hierarchical modelling. We illustrate the approach with applications to studies evaluating erosion in embankment dams and pump failures in a water pumping station, and assess the properties of the approach using the TU Delft database of expert judgement studies. We see that, even using an off-the-shelf implementation of the approach, it out-performs individual experts, equal weighting of experts and the classical method based on the log score.},
